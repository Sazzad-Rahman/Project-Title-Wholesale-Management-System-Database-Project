# Project-Title-Wholesale-Management-System-Database-Project
Create a database-driven system with tables for stock, buyers, purchases, customers, defaulters, and payments. Manage stock quantities, buyer information, customer details, track defaulters, record payments, prevent overselling, and calculate monthly profits. Maintain purchase dates for stock delivery planning.

Objective:
Our main goal is to build a database for wholesale management systems. In our system, 
customer and supplier data will be stored with security. All data can be easily accessible and
can be viewed by the admin and user. This system will ease the hard work to track all data and 
can be easily maintainable. Data can be updated or deleted from the database. We are going to 
use SQL query language to develop our system.

EXTRA OPTIONS:
 MAX_CREDIT
(There will be a limit of how much a customer retailer can purchase, so that all the other 
customer can have their fair share to buy product)
 POSITION
(With this in future admin can create role to revoke access or grant staff member access 
on other table)
 QUALITY
(this will help the worker to keep track of any supplier who’s delivered product quality is 
good or bad, it can be used to monitor the product and the supplier of the product)
